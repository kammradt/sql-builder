## Description 📝  
  
I was studying the builder pattern and decided to apply in a real problem.  
This was a funny project to do, but please: **Don't take it seriously**
> This project does not want in any way be a product, the-best-solution nor compete with any other similar project, this is just a the result of a learning process :stuck_out_tongue:  
> > If you are searching for a real SQL builder using python, please check out at [PyPika](https://github.com/kayak/pypika) or [Ibis](https://ibis-project.org/) 

## How to use :pencil2:  

> You can also verify all examples at `examples.py`.
